## Features
* Working through a lesson should work not just on perfect case:
    * ~~User's should be able to complete blocks in any order.~~
    * ~~If a user shows an explanation w/out answering it should still count the block as completed.~~
    * If a user answers incorrectly and then clicks explain it should count block as completed.
* User should be able to upvote/downvote lessons.


## Bugs
* Creating Block Math inserts a newline before the block which cannot be removed.
    * see: https://trello.com/c/ypV7jNOd/76-creating-block-math-inserts-a-newline-before-the-block-which-cannot-be-removed
* On Multiple Choice questions, the option "Can the user select only one answer?" has a disabled/enabled delay, it works but the behavior is very odd.
