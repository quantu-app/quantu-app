## Features
* Remove gtag completely; it is blocked by most browsers these days.
    * Reason: We want something more privacy preserving for our users. Perhaps a self-hosted: https://plausible.io/, or something like that.
* Working through a lesson should work not just on perfect case:
    * User's should be able to complete blocks in any order.
    * If a user shows an explanation w/out answering it should still count the block as completed.
    * If a user answers incorrectly and then clicks explain it should count block as completed.
* User should be able to upvote/downvote lessons.


## Bugs
* Creating Block Math inserts a newline before the block which cannot be removed.
