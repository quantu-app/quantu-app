				<h2>Our Vision</h2>

				<p>
					The vision for QuantU is to provide the world's best learning platform for life-long
					learners.
				</p>

				<p>
					We are primarly focused on the quantitative disciplines and sciences, especially
					mathematics. Right now, mainly due to limited resources, we are focusing exclusively on
					mathematics, but given enough community support and involvement we would love to
					eventually be able to expand to close scientific fields such as physics, finance or
					computer science and perhaps one day even further.
				</p>
				<p>
					Central to our learning philosophy is the idea of <strong>life-long learning</strong>. We
					believe that not only in order to succeed in the 21st century, but simply to be able to
					explore and enjoy the beauty of knowledge in the universe, learning is something that
					should not be done once in high school or university, and then left to be forgotten, but
					rather something that each individual does on a daily basis, slowly increasing their
					understanding of the world, improving their skills, and enhancing their ability to
					navigate complex problems they encounter.
				</p>
				<p>
					A further pillar in our vision is <strong>research backed optimized learning</strong> that
					is, learning done in such a way that you forget as little as possible and waste as little time
					as possible while gaining deep understanding. Learning should build knowledge and understanding
					that becomes integrated with your abilities such that you can apply whatever you have learned
					to your own projects, research or other endeavors in the real-world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Learning should also be <strong>fun and enjoyable</strong>, like playing sports or video
					games or music.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want to build a community of like-minded people who love learning and creating high
					quality learning content and we want to be able to provide life-long learners across the
					globe with affordable and easy access to these educational resources while simultaneously
					providing incredible content creators with a means for sustaining themselves while doing
					what they love.
				</p>
				<p>
					To be honest, right now we don't know how the monetary machinary can best work with our
					ideas. We know we need funds, in-so-far as it enables us to build a better product and
					dedicate more resources and time to it. Beyond this, our only goals are to build a
					transparent and distributed organization such that QuantU revenues are community owned and
					equitably distributed in the form of increases in earnings for creators and as cheaper
					prices for life-long learners across the globe.
				</p>
				<p>
					These are our goals for the moment and we ask that you join us not only in achieving them,
					but in shaping their evolution into the future.
