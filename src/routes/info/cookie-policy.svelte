				<p>
					Please remember that your use of the Services is at all times subject to the
					<a href="/info/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>
					and
					<a href="/info/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>, which incorporates this Cookie Policy.
					Any terms we use in this Cookie Policy without defining them have the definitions given to

					and
					<a href="/info/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.

				<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
				<p>
					The services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear
					GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage. Cookies are small files - usually consisting of
					letters and numbers - placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device, when you
					use that device to visit a Site. We will refer to cookies and similar technologies simply
					as "Cookies" for the remainder of this Cookie Policy. We use cookies to enable our servers
					to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the
					Services through the internet, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user base.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through cookies with
					other Personal Information that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or
					whether you have an account. We may also supplement the information we collect from you
					with information received from third parties in order to enhance our Services, or to offer
					you information that we believe may be of interest to you. Where we use Cookies to collect
					information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if
					we combine it with other information, the QuantU
					<a href="/info/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>
					will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish - for details, see
					<a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">aboutcookies.org</a>. Most
					browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your
					browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your
					browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of
					ways. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most
					browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to
					manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and
					functionalities may not work. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because
					they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services.

				<h2>What Types of Cookies Do We Use and For Which Purposes?</h2>
				<p>We use the following types of Cookies:</p>
				<br />
				<h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
				<p>
					These are cookies that are required to provide you with features or services that you have
					requested. For example, Cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our site or
					use a shopping cart. Disabling these Cookies will encumber the Services’ performance and
					may make certain features and services unavailable.
				</p>
				<h3>Analytical Cookies</h3>
				<p>
					These Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our site. This includes information
					about the number of visitors to the site, what pages visitors view on our site and how
					long visitors are viewing pages on the site. Analytical Cookies also help us measure the
					performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our advertising
					campaigns and to optimize our Services’ content for those who engage with our advertising.
				</p>
				<h3>Third Party Cookies</h3>
				<p>
					These are Cookies placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to
					those third parties about browsing habits (including your visits to our Services, the
					pages you have visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked) that may help
					identify if certain services that such third parties provide are being used, identify your
					interests, retarget you and serve advertisements that are relevant to you. We do not have
					control or access to such Cookies. If you look at one page on our Services, an
					advertisement may be delivered to you on our Services or on other sites, for products
					referenced on that page or for similar products and services. We do not engage in
					retargeted advertising for children users of our Services.
				</p>
				<h3>Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies</h3>
				<p>
					The types of Cookies described above may be "session Cookies" which are temporary Cookies
					that are only stored on your device while you are visiting our site or "persistent
					Cookies" which are Cookies that are stored on your device for a period of time after you
					leave our site. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from
					Cookie to Cookie. We use persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are
					available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit
					our Services, how often you return, how your use of the Services may vary over time, and
					measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, we may collect
					information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other
					usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and
					customize your online experience. Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option,
					which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services
					(including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track
					certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do
					not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information
					about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave the
					Services.
				</p>
				<br />
				<br />

					You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies. One way you can do this is through your
					internet browser’s settings. To find our more information about Cookies, including
