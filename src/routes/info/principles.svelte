				<h2>Our Values</h2>

				<p>
					We've selected our specific values because we think they help us be better people and
					build better products than we otherwise would have.
				</p>

				<h4>Transparency</h4>

				<p>
					Tell the truth. Be honest. This goes from feedback meetings, to reports, to talking with
					others over a cup of coffee.
				</p>
				<h4>Humility</h4>

				<p>
					Never assume you have all the answers. Always ask, "Am I sure?" and be open to learning
					from others persectives and experiences.
				</p>
				<h4>Teamwork</h4>

				<p>Other people make</p>

				<h4>Kindness</h4>

				<p>
					Do unto others and you would have them do unto you, or in other words really put yourself
					in the next person's shoes, understand their view and try to treat them as kind and well
					as you wish someone would treat you if you were in their position.
				</p>

				<h4>Love</h4>

				<p>
					With our products, interactions with other people both internally and externally we should
					be spreading positiveness, joy and love.

				<h2>Our Path</h2>

				<p>Our path is more of a process which has two core pillars or subcomponents.</p>
				<p>These are:</p>

				<ol class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">
						<strong>Gaming and Community</strong>
						<span>-</span>
						We think using gamification and building a community can maximize enjoyment and fun, and
						additionally, help <strong>life-long learners</strong> stay motivated and passionate.
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">
						<strong>Learning Science</strong>
						<span>-</span>
						By building our learning software based off insights gained from the latest research in the
						learning sciences, we think we can optimize the learning experience to maximize acquired
						knowledge and skills and minimize time required to attain them.
